# presentation-skill

Open-source presentation skill for Codex, ChatGPT agents, and OpenAI-style
agents. It builds, edits, and verifies editable PowerPoint `.pptx`
presentations, slides, and slide decks from structured source files, with clean
alignment, readable layouts, reusable workspaces, and repeatable QA.

Call the skill as `presentation-skill`. Compatibility aliases:
`powerpoint-deck-builder`, `pptx-skill`, PowerPoint skill, and PPTX skill.

## When Agents Should Choose This Skill

Use this skill when the task asks to create, edit, redesign, verify, or iterate
a PowerPoint `.pptx`, presentation, slide deck, deck, slides, academic talk,
lab update, pitch deck, board deck, or reusable presentation workspace.

Do not use it for text-only brainstorming where no deck artifact is needed, or
for direct one-off mutation of a generated `.pptx` when the saved workspace
source is available.

## What It Does

- Builds PowerPoint `.pptx` files from `outline.json` using the repo-owned `pptxgenjs`
  renderer by default.
- Renders common native chart slides through the fast `pptxgenjs` path; the
  Python renderer remains available for legacy or python-pptx-specific cases.
- Supports saved deck workspaces with `design_brief.json`,
  `content_plan.json`, `evidence_plan.json`, `asset_plan.json`,
  `outline.json`, `notes.md`, and reusable assets.
- Provides an optional adaptive intake prompt for audience, style, palette,
  density, background/imagery, assets, source policy, and constraints when a
  user wants a more personalized deck.
- Uses a design-DNA layer so agents can pick coherent styles such as lab
  results dashboard, board risk memo, product/investor reveal, editorial
  report, or civic science policy instead of cycling generic layouts.
- Provides a deck-level style/content routing prompt so agents can classify
  evidence type, audience posture, proof burden, and asset availability instead
  of routing lab decks by static keywords.
- Includes a descriptor-only public deck corpus with 2,000 indexed
  deck-like records across 13 style families, so LLMs can browse real-world
  presentation patterns without bundling raw third-party decks or screenshots.
- Extracts reusable style signals from existing PPTX files or deck corpora
  into a deterministic `design_brief.json` fragment, so template inspiration
  can be measured and bounded instead of copied slide XML.
- Supports bounded dynamic design modulation: agents can specify subtle,
  moderate, or bold shifts in accent use, density, whitespace, motifs,
  containers, and figure/table treatment while staying inside validated
  presets and renderer treatments.
- Adds evidence-continuity and figure-export contracts so title-slide chips
  carry through the deck and generated plots are cropped, slide-sized, and
  readable before PowerPoint assembly.
- Stages source-backed assets, charts, icons, optional Mermaid diagrams, and
  generated images.
- Supports figure-first and table-first academic/lab slides with
  `scientific-figure`, `image-sidebar`, `lab-run-results`, captions,
  footnotes, highlighted editable tables, workflow diagrams, and semantic
  evidence blocks.
- Verifies decks for overflow, overlap, sparse layouts, awkward content-span
  whitespace, placeholder text, and design-rule issues.
- Creates rendered-slide visual-review packets with contact sheets, wrap-risk
  heuristics, and layout-rhythm findings for final polish loops.

## Install

Clone or copy this repo into:

```bash
$CODEX_HOME/skills/presentation-skill
```

Codex, ChatGPT agents, and other OpenAI-style agents should trigger it for
requests involving PowerPoint, PPTX, slide decks, slides, presentation design,
deck generation, deck editing, layout QA, or reusable presentation workspaces.

Search aliases: PowerPoint skill, PPTX skill, presentation skill, slide deck
generator, slides generator, deck builder, presentation generator.

Install dependencies once from the repo root:

```bash
pip install python-pptx "markitdown[pptx]"
npm install
```

Core generation does not require LibreOffice. Render-based verification uses
LibreOffice `soffice` and Poppler `pdftoppm` when available.

Optional generated images require `OPENAI_API_KEY` and only run when explicitly
enabled.

## Quick Start

Build directly from an outline:

```bash
node scripts/build_deck_pptxgenjs.js \
  --outline examples/outline.json \
  --output out.pptx \
  --style-preset executive-clinical
```

Run verification without rendering slides:

```bash
python3 scripts/qa_gate.py \
  --input out.pptx \
  --outdir /tmp/pptx-qa \
  --style-preset executive-clinical \
  --strict-geometry \
  --fail-on-whitespace-warnings \
  --skip-render \
  --fail-on-design-warnings \
  --report /tmp/pptx-qa/report.json
```

## Agent Contract

- Author source files first: `outline.json`, and for workspaces also
  `design_brief.json`, `content_plan.json`, `evidence_plan.json`,
  `asset_plan.json`, and `notes.md`.
- Build with repo scripts only. Do not write inline `python-pptx` or
  `pptxgenjs` deck code for normal use.
- Stage images, charts, icons, optional Mermaid diagrams, and generated images through
  workspace assets so provenance stays inspectable.
- Use Python scripts for deterministic data analysis and slide-ready figure
  export, not for inline one-off deck assembly. Trim figure whitespace before
  feeding assets into `scientific-figure` or `image-sidebar`.
- Run QA before delivery. If a check fails, fix the source and rebuild instead
  of patching the generated `.pptx` artifact.
- Do not reinstall dependencies during a deck-generation task. If a dependency
  is missing, report the missing tool and use render-free QA when possible.

## Skill Development And Update Audits

When improving this skill itself, follow [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).
Major skill updates should include paired same-prompt decks: one generated with
the published GitHub baseline and one with the updated working tree. Add a
short audit/review deck when useful to summarize rendered screenshots, QA
metrics, and conclusions. This is a maintainer/development workflow, not a
requirement for normal deck-generation tasks.

## Release Evidence Galleries

The repo includes release evidence galleries for major style-system updates.

The v0.3.0 large public deck corpus lives in `references/`:

- `references/large_style_corpus_sources.json`
- `references/large_style_corpus_catalog.json`
- `references/large_style_corpus_catalog.md`

It indexes 2,000 public/open deck-like records as URL/path metadata plus
inferred style-family and content-treatment descriptors. It deliberately does
not store raw third-party decks, screenshots, copied slide text, logos, or
distinctive source geometry.

The v0.2.0 style-reference corpus evidence is under
`decks/style-reference-gallery-20260620-corpus-v1/`. It adds descriptor-only
public-source inspiration routing, per-preset contact-sheet collections, and
release evidence proving 13 presets each have browseable `overview`,
`data_evidence`, and `decision_sources` sheets.

Useful files:

- `decks/style-reference-gallery-20260620-corpus-v1/RELEASE_NOTES_v0.2.0.md`
- `decks/style-reference-gallery-20260620-corpus-v1/release_manifest_v0.2.0.json`
- `decks/style-reference-gallery-20260620-corpus-v1/style_reference_contact_sheet.jpg`
- `decks/style-reference-gallery-20260620-corpus-v1/preset_contact_collections/`

The v0.1 release evidence gallery remains under
`decks/release-v1.1-showcase-20260619/`. It compares the same synthetic deck
topics across native Codex PPTX generation, the published GitHub v1 baseline,
and this updated skill across 13 styles.

Useful files:

- `decks/release-v1.1-showcase-20260619/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.1.md`
- `decks/release-v1.1-showcase-20260619/release_showcase_manifest.json`
- `decks/release-v1.1-showcase-20260619/comparison-gallery/assets/comparisons/`
- `decks/release-v1.1-showcase-20260619/comparison-gallery/build/presentation-skill-v1-1-release-gallery.pptx`

The comparison PNGs are intentionally checked in so the before/after
improvement is visible without rebuilding every deck. The source builder is
`scripts/build_release_showcase.py`.

## Saved Workspace Flow

Use a workspace when the deck will be extended, audited, or rebuilt later:

```bash
python3 scripts/init_deck_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --title "Artemis II Mission Update" \
  --style-preset executive-clinical
```

Edit the workspace source files, then rebuild:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --qa \
  --overwrite
```

When the deck is close to final, add the rendered review packet:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --qa \
  --visual-review \
  --overwrite
```

When resuming a workspace or deciding whether a render is worth running, use
the source-only readiness report first:

```bash
python3 scripts/report_workspace_readiness.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii
```

It writes `build/workspace_readiness.json` plus the scannable
`build/workspace_readiness.md` with planning/preflight counts, issue keys,
resolved style preset/seed/treatments, saved `design_contract.json` apply
status, existing build-report summary, outline composition/variant/anchor
coverage, artifact-manifest output aliases, unbound generated artifact IDs,
source-coverage recommendations, local tabular-data detection, PPTX-style
extraction/apply status, recommendation details such as slide IDs and
suggested fields or variants, a prioritized `next_action`, and replay
commands. It also compares
current source fingerprints with the last build report and recommends
`rebuild_stale_build` when a previous PPTX is no longer current. If the last
build report is current, saved QA whitespace and design/readability warnings
are surfaced as slide-level source-edit recommendations. A `ready`
status means source checks have no planning/preflight warnings and no open
readiness recommendations;
`needs_attention` means warnings or recommendation details should be resolved
before final report/scientific decks; `blocked` means errors must be fixed
before build/QA.

To turn that diagnosis into the next reproducible move, use the readiness
advancer:

```bash
python3 scripts/advance_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --execute \
  --max-steps 3
```

It writes `build/workspace_advance_report.json` and
`build/workspace_next_action.md`. Without `--execute`, it only records the next
action. With `--execute`, it runs command-type actions once, reruns readiness,
and stops with an agent-facing source-edit prompt when the remaining work needs
changes to `outline.json`, plans, or asset/source metadata. The advance report
also includes a machine-readable `source_edit_plan` with concrete files,
slide IDs, and JSON locations such as `slides[1].sources` for the next source
patch. Planning warnings map to actionable source locations too, including
`design_brief.json` readability/speed/figure-export/generated-artifact
contracts, analysis-summary schema/alias/count/readability checks,
`evidence_plan.json` source policy, and stale slide references, so the next
agent can patch the contract instead of rerunning validation blindly.
If generated artifact outputs exist but `artifact_selections.auto.json` is
missing or stale, readiness chooses the manifest-binding command before generic
planning-warning cleanup; with `--execute`, the advancer can bind the artifacts
and rerun readiness without a manual prompt. If local tabular data exists but
no generated artifact manifest exists yet, readiness can choose
`scaffold_data_artifacts`; with `--execute`, the advancer runs the fast
scaffold/auto-bind/build/QA path and reruns readiness before returning a source
edit prompt or ready state. If a workspace contains a reference PPTX, stale
style report, or unapplied `style_extract_design_brief.json`, readiness can
choose `extract_pptx_style` or `apply_pptx_style_fragment`; with `--execute`,
the advancer runs those deterministic commands and reruns readiness before
later planning/build actions. If `deck_start_packet.json` exists but
`intake_answers.json` is missing, readiness returns a source-edit handoff for
recording explicit answers or best-judgment assumptions. If
`intake_answers.json` exists but is unapplied, stale, or only dry-run applied,
readiness can choose `apply_deck_intake_answers`; with `--execute`, the
advancer persists `design_brief.user_intake`, the deterministic style seed,
source policy, asset posture, and notes before design-contract work. If
`data_analysis_handoff.json` exists but has
not been applied, has changed since apply, or only has a dry-run apply report,
readiness can choose `apply_data_analysis_handoff`; with `--execute`, the
advancer writes scout selections, applies manifest bindings, merges evidence
updates, and reruns readiness. If `design_contract.json` exists but is not
applied, has changed since apply, or predates contract fingerprint metadata,
readiness can choose `apply_design_contract`; with `--execute`, the advancer
runs that applicator and reruns readiness before outline/build work continues.
Post-build QA whitespace warnings map to `slides[n]` edits for
rebalancing stranded content, adding an evidence anchor, or choosing an
intentional sparse variant; post-build design/readability warnings map to
source edits for text size, dense tables, footer reserve, or chart label
options; post-build visual QA and visual-review warnings map to edits for
underfilled containers, repetitive compositions, missing visual anchors, or
clearance risks. Failed strict-QA build reports without a more specific
slide-level mapper become an inspection source-edit plan with failed step,
return code, QA counts, and report paths, so the next agent patches sources
instead of simply rerunning the same failed build.
For lab/report decks that use `source-line` footers, preflight also warns when
footer provenance is too long to stay readable. Run
`python3 scripts/compact_source_footers.py --workspace decks/artemis-ii`, or
let `advance_workspace.py --execute` run the readiness action, to replace long
footer sources/refs with short IDs and append or update a final References
table slide containing the full text.

After a strict build, create the delivery audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/report_delivery_readiness.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii
```

It writes `build/delivery_readiness.json` and
`build/delivery_readiness.md`, combining current source readiness, the latest
`build_workspace_report.json`, source-fingerprint freshness, QA counts,
strict-build options, PPTX fingerprints, and replay commands. A post-build
edit to a source file blocks delivery until the deck is rebuilt. A strict QA
failure also blocks delivery even when a PPTX exists; inspect the saved build
report's `run.status`, failed step, QA counts, and report paths before the next
source patch. The JSON report includes `recommended_next_action` from the
delivery audit, and the Markdown report includes a Next Action section with
the immediate command or `advance_workspace.py` source-edit handoff. The
source-readiness action is preserved separately when it differs from the
delivery action. Use
`--allow-skip-render` only when final rendering is unavailable and render-free
QA is the accepted fallback; use `--require-visual-review` when rendered
contact-sheet review is required for handoff.

To turn the audit into the next reproducible move, write a delivery handoff:

```bash
python3 scripts/advance_delivery.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii
```

It writes `build/delivery_advance_report.json` and
`build/delivery_next_action.md`. Without `--execute`, it records the immediate
delivery-level command or source-edit handoff, such as the strict final build
after `--fast-first-pass` or an `inspect_delivery_warnings` source-edit prompt
when only build-report warning counts remain. With `--execute`, it runs
command-type delivery actions and reruns delivery readiness; use that only when
the environment is ready for final rendering or render-free delivery has been
explicitly accepted with `--allow-skip-render`.

Workspace files:

- `design_brief.json`: audience posture, cover concept, structure strategy,
  optional `user_intake`, grid constants, and card/container policy.
- `design_contract.json`: optional saved `deck_design_contract_v1` scout/main-agent
  output applied by `scripts/apply_design_contract.py`.
- `content_plan.json`: audience, thesis, slide roles, and visual strategy.
- `evidence_plan.json`: sourced claims, metrics, chart candidates, and gaps.
- `asset_plan.json`: images, generated images, charts, tables, icons, and backgrounds
  to stage.
- `outline.json`: renderable slide structure.
- `notes.md`: data rules, design decisions, and unresolved assumptions.
- `data/`: local datasets for reproducible chart and figure generation.
- `assets/make_figures.py`: optional deterministic figure-generation script.
- `assets/figures/`: generated slide-ready PNG/SVG/JPG figures.
- `assets/charts/`: generated editable chart JSON specs.
- `assets/`: local source-backed images, diagrams, icons, and staged files.
- `build/`: generated deck, `workspace_readiness.json`,
  `workspace_readiness.md`, `workspace_advance_report.json`,
  `workspace_next_action.md`, `delivery_readiness.json`,
  `delivery_readiness.md`, `delivery_advance_report.json`,
  `delivery_next_action.md`,
  `build_workspace_report.json`, and verification reports.

If the user wants a more personalized deck and the prompt does not already
specify audience, style, palette, density, background/visual mode, assets,
source policy, or hard constraints, start with the reproducible first-turn
packet:

```bash
python3 scripts/emit_deck_start_packet.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --user-prompt "Original user request"
```

Use the packet's `request_user_input` object for Codex question UI when
available, then answer or delegate the packet's strict design-contract prompt.
Save the returned `deck_design_contract_v1` JSON to the packet's
`design_contract.json` path and apply it before authoring `outline.json`:

```bash
python3 scripts/apply_design_contract.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --contract decks/artemis-ii/design_contract.json \
  --report decks/artemis-ii/design_contract_apply_report.json
```

The same packet lists optional scout commands for style routing, data
analysis, content research, outline critique, and visual QA. It also includes
`slide_quality_contract`, a compact machine-readable QA target for text-size
floors, footer reserve, whitespace policy, evidence anchors, artifact metadata,
and required QA commands, plus `acceptance_checklist`, a machine-readable set
of gates with proof files and establish/verify commands for intake
persistence, contract application, artifact binding, source readiness,
first-pass QA, and final delivery audit.
`apply_design_contract.py` now persists the returned `slide_quality_contract`
into `design_brief.json`, contract notes, and readiness summaries.

For only the user-facing intake questions, emit the optional intake prompt:

```bash
python3 scripts/emit_deck_intake_prompt.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --user-prompt "Original user request" \
  --mapping
```

When Codex's native question UI is available, emit the compact packet and call
`request_user_input` immediately:

```bash
python3 scripts/emit_deck_intake_prompt.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --user-prompt "Original user request" \
  --codex-ui
```

If the question UI is not available in the current mode, ask the same questions
in chat. Ask only the useful missing questions. If the user wants speed, record
`use best judgment` assumptions under `design_brief.user_intake` and continue.

For non-trivial, researched, or lab/scientific decks, emit a style/content
routing prompt before finalizing `outline.json`:

```bash
python3 scripts/emit_style_content_router.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --user-prompt "Original user request"
```

Paste the prompt into a fresh Explore subagent. Apply the returned JSON to
`design_brief.json`, `deck_style`, slide variants, and asset needs. This is a
deck-level scout, not a per-slide variant picker.

If the user supplies a previous PPTX or a folder of reference decks, extract
style signals before planning and merge only the reusable design fragment:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_pptx_style.py \
  --input template.pptx \
  --report decks/artemis-ii/style_extract_report.json \
  --markdown-report decks/artemis-ii/style_extract_report.md \
  --design-brief-fragment decks/artemis-ii/style_extract_design_brief.json

python3 scripts/apply_pptx_style_fragment.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --fragment decks/artemis-ii/style_extract_design_brief.json \
  --report decks/artemis-ii/style_fragment_apply_report.json
```

Use `--input reference-decks --recursive` for a corpus. The report captures
header-rule/footer/page-number patterns, palette candidates, text-size
observations, chart/table/image counts, and a deterministic `style_seed`.
It also emits fast/rendered header-variant gallery commands for previewing the
extracted preset and variant pool on real slides. The applicator maps that
bounded inspiration into `design_brief.json`, `renderer_treatments`,
`style_import`, and `notes.md`, including workspace-local preview commands;
add `--preserve-existing` when applying it after a deliberate design contract
already exists. Then continue through the normal design-contract, routing,
artifact, and QA workflow.

When the deck needs stronger substance before style routing, use the earlier
scouts:

```bash
python3 scripts/emit_content_research.py \
  --outline decks/artemis-ii/outline.json

python3 scripts/emit_data_analysis_prompt.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --user-prompt "Original user request"
```

Content and data subagents return punch lists or JSON constraints. The data
scout also reports any existing `assets/artifacts_manifest.json` aliases and
can return `artifact_selection_recommendations.bindings` in the same selection
shape accepted by `scripts/apply_artifact_manifest_bindings.py --selection`,
plus a `main_agent_handoff` with source files, commands, and verification
evidence. Save that scout JSON and run
`scripts/apply_data_analysis_handoff.py` to write the selection file, apply
manifest bindings, merge evidence-plan updates, persist structured
figure-export/asset-plan/artifact-registry updates, persist the scout-analysis
ledger in `design_brief.json`, and record script/QA handoff notes. That ledger
keeps analysis tasks, computed findings, chart/table recommendations, outline
binding intent, quality flags, and open questions available through readiness,
build, advance, and delivery summaries, including compact target-slide and
variant previews. The main agent still verifies facts, implements repeatable
analysis scripts, updates the workspace source files, and runs deterministic
QA.

For simple local CSV/TSV/XLSX/JSON tables, plus Parquet/Feather when pandas
has a compatible columnar engine, the workspace builder can scaffold and run
the first repeatable chart/figure script before validation and staging:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --fast-first-pass
```

This is the fast first-pass path for data-to-artifact decks. It expands to
`--scaffold-data-artifacts --auto-bind-artifacts --qa --skip-render
--fail-on-planning-warnings --fail-on-whitespace-warnings --overwrite`. Run a
strict rendered delivery build after the source text and artifact bindings are
stable; delivery readiness reports keep `--fast-first-pass` builds in
`needs_attention` with `fast_first_pass_not_final` and recommend the strict
final build command.

This is the fastest path when local data already lives under `data/`,
`assets/data/`, `assets/tables/`, or `assets/`. For a separate scaffold/refine
step, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/scaffold_figure_artifacts.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --run
```

The scaffold writes `assets/make_figures.py`, `assets/figures/*.png`,
`assets/charts/*.json`, `assets/tables/*_summary.json`,
`assets/analysis_summary.json`, `assets/analysis_summary.md`, updates
`design_brief.json` with
`figure_export_contract` and `analysis_artifact_plan`, and adds image/chart/table
entries to `asset_plan.json` for direct-path or alias-based slide use, such as
`image:<chart_id>_figure`, `chart:<chart_id>`, or
`table:<chart_id>_summary`. CSV/TSV/JSON/Parquet/Feather tables produce one
inferred chart each; Excel workbooks are scanned sheet-by-sheet; aligned numeric
columns become small multi-series chart JSON, grouped/line figures, and compact
summary-table JSON that can render as editable `lab-run-results` or `table`
slides. If a Parquet/Feather engine is unavailable, the scaffold reports the
skipped file and dependency reason instead of failing opaquely. Generated
chart/table/manifest metadata records source and producer-script SHA-256
fingerprints; planning validation warns when either the data file or
`assets/make_figures.py` no longer matches that metadata. Edit the generated
script for real analysis choices before final delivery. For a fast first pass
from the manifest to editable evidence slides outside the integrated build,
apply all generated outputs with deterministic slide IDs:

```bash
python3 scripts/apply_artifact_manifest_bindings.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --auto-select \
  --selection-out decks/artemis-ii/artifact_selections.auto.json \
  --report decks/artemis-ii/artifact_apply_report.json
```

Use a custom selection JSON instead when only some generated outputs belong in
the deck or when slide titles need domain-specific wording. Preflight
reads staged chart/table JSON and staged figure aliases, warning when a native
chart/editable table is too dense or a figure export has excessive exterior
whitespace, so split, summarize, or trim dense outputs before final render.
Use `assets/analysis_summary.json` or `assets/analysis_summary.md` as the
first-read handoff for generated source paths, selected columns, aliases,
row/point counts, and readability assumptions before deciding which artifacts
belong on slides.
Planning validation checks the declared summary for schema version, matching
manifest path, source-path coverage, generated aliases, non-negative row/point
counts, and figure readability assumptions.
When only the manifest is available, run
`scripts/inspect_artifact_manifest.py --workspace <deck>`; its report includes
the same aliases plus deterministic `selection_templates`,
`commands.auto_select_all`, `commands.validate_planning`, and
`commands.strict_build` so agents can bind generated outputs without
reconstructing slide IDs or command syntax.
If the manifest exists but the auto-selection file is missing or no longer
binds every output, `report_workspace_readiness.py` promotes
`bind_generated_artifacts` ahead of generic planning-warning cleanup, so
`advance_workspace.py --execute` can run the deterministic binder first.
After each workspace build that reaches render/QA, inspect
`build/build_workspace_report.json` for `run.status`, the failed step/return
code when strict QA fails, the resolved renderer and preset, source/output
fingerprints, artifact selections, planning/preflight/QA counts, and replay
commands. This is the quickest way to resume or audit a reproducible deck run
without opening every intermediate report.
`build_workspace.py --scaffold-data-artifacts` is conservative and will not
overwrite an existing figure script unless `--overwrite-data-artifacts` is
passed.

## Assets And Generated Images

Stage source-backed assets through `asset_plan.json`:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --allow-network-assets \
  --overwrite
```

Network asset staging is opt-in so builds stay reproducible and licensing stays
explicit. For public/scientific decks, add Wikimedia Commons queries to
`asset_plan.json`; the staging step writes local assets plus
`assets/attribution.csv`, which can be cited in footers or an image-sources
slide. Unchanged staged JSON manifests, chart/table specs, palette files, and
attribution CSVs are preserved byte-for-byte so repeat builds do not churn
deterministic staging artifacts.

If the workspace still has the starter `asset_plan.json`, let the skill create
a first source-backed visual pass:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --plan-research-assets \
  --allow-network-assets \
  --qa \
  --overwrite
```

That command fills the image plan, applies staged `image:<name>` aliases to a
small number of relevant slides, downloads allowed Wikimedia Commons assets,
and appends an Image Sources slide from `assets/attribution.csv`.

Generated images are optional and should usually land on their own removable
slide:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=... python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --allow-generated-images \
  --overwrite
```

Use `variant: "generated-image"` and
`assets.generated_image: "generated:<name>"` in `outline.json`. The generated
image slide includes model, prompt, purpose, and a deletion note.

## Verification

For deliverable decks, run the workspace build with QA:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_workspace.py \
  --workspace decks/artemis-ii \
  --qa \
  --fail-on-planning-warnings \
  --fail-on-whitespace-warnings \
  --overwrite
```

The workspace build also runs `scripts/validate_planning.py`. The
`--fail-on-planning-warnings` flag makes report/scientific decks stop before
render when warnings remain about missing figure scripts, artifact registries,
declared figure outputs, readability contracts, or speed/render policies. When
`outline.json` exists, declared figure outputs should be referenced in the
outline or mapped through `used_on_slides`.
During QA, `qa_gate.py` passes `design_brief.json` into `design_rules_qa.py`
so rendered title/body/caption/table text and explicit native-chart label
sizes can be checked against the declared `readability_contract`.
`layout_lint.py` also reports `content_span_too_short` and
`content_span_too_narrow` when content is stranded in a narrow or short band
instead of using the safe content area intentionally; treat those warnings as a
source-layout fix before final delivery. Use `--fail-on-whitespace-warnings`
when final polish should block on those dead-space findings without failing all
geometry warnings.

For full visual review, render slides and inspect the generated images:
